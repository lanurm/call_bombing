## 2. What are Call Bombers?

### 2.1 Definition
Call bombers are tools or scripts designed to initiate a large number of phone calls to a target number. These tools exploit telephony systems to repeatedly dial the target, leading to significant disruptions in their ability to use their phone effectively.

### 2.2 Technical Mechanism
Call bombers typically employ VoIP (Voice over IP) services, automated dialing systems, or telephony APIs. These mechanisms allow the bombers to place numerous calls in rapid succession, often making it difficult for the target to respond to legitimate calls.

#### Attack Mechanism
- **VoIP Services:** Utilize VoIP services to initiate multiple calls from virtual phone numbers, making it challenging to trace the origin.
- **Automated Dialing Systems:** Leverage automated systems to place calls at high frequencies, exploiting telephony APIs to bypass traditional call limits.
- **API Exploits:** Use telephony APIs to programmatically generate call requests, often bypassing rate limits or security measures.

### 2.3 Impact
The primary impacts of call bombers include:
- **Disruption of Communication:** Targets may be unable to receive legitimate calls due to the flood of spam calls.
- **Annoyance and Stress:** Continuous calls can cause significant stress and frustration for the recipient.
- **Service Issues:** Repeated bombardment may result in service provider actions against the recipient or even lead to temporary suspension of service.
